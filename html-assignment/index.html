<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
My name is Hicham Hazel, and I am an <em>ambitious</em>, calm, and sociable student originally from Algeria. I currently live in Ottawa, right next to Algonquin College. I am deeply passionate about sports, particularly basketball and soccer, and I spend a lot of my free time watching <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr> games or cheering for my favorite soccer club, <strong>FC Barcelona</strong>, from Spain.
</p>

<p>
Beyond sports, I am a true adventurer who loves exploring the world through activities like sea diving and climbing mountains. I enjoy visiting new places<sup>1</sup> and seeking out fresh adventures that challenge me. When I want to relax, I often find myself reading books, watching movies, or catching up on my favorite television shows to broaden my perspective on life.
