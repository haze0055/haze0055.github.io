<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
My name is <em>Hicham Hazel</em>, and i am an ambitious, calm, and sociable student originally from Algeria. Since moving to Ottawa and living right next to Algonquin College, i have focused on balancing my academic goals with my love for global sports.I am a dedicated follower of the <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr>, often staying up late to watch live games, and i am a lifelong supporter of <strong>FC Barcelona</strong>, from Spain. For me, football is more than just a game; it is a way to stay connected to my roots while embracing the competitive spirit of my new environment here in canada.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the screen, i seek out real-world adventures that push my physical limits. Whether i am sea diving in the mediterranean or climbing mountains, i believe that life is best lived outside of one's comfort zone. i have a personal motto that i call my "Rule of 1<sup>st</sup>" which reminds me to always try a new adventure at least once before forming an opinion. This mindset drives me to visit new places and read widely, ensuring that i am constantly learning and growing as an individual, no matter where my journey takes me next.
